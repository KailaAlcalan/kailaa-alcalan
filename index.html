--About 70,000 of the cumulative approvals either didn’t renew or were rejected when trying to renew. About 40,000 became lawful permanent residents</h4>

<h4>--In September, the Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) – which provides a level of amnesty to certain undocumented immigrants, many of whom came to the U.S. as children – with a six-month delay for recipients<br>

They live in the shadows, spend days burning beneath the sun working in agriculture, freezing during winter to build the houses you live in, scrapping together dollar after dollar after cleaning tables or cooking your food, without complaining, for fear of deportation, fear of being taken away from their families and from the communities they have built. Their only hope is that the children they brought in with them can one day reach the American Dream that was denied to them.</h4>

<h3 class="words">In the end, despite the bipartisan effort, the Trump administration rejected the bill on January 11th, saying the legislation needed more work.
But while Congress works on a permanent solution, DACA allies have found other ways to ensure Dreamers remain protected.
On January 10th, a ruling from a California judge blocked Trump’s DACA repeal, meaning that those who had once been covered by the bill could reapply.</h3>

<h3 class="words">Even for the DREAMers who just want a deal, it’s clear that they don’t lack concern for future immigrants — it’s just that they themselves know they can’t go on like this for several more years. “Frankly, many DREAMers like myself are tired of the constant back and forth, waking up one day with hope and then going to bed in tears,” said Illinois DACA recipient Diego Quevedo. The White House framework is “far from what I would like,” he said, and he hoped it could be moderated in negotiation, but it would “provide us with some stability.” </h3>

<h3 class="words">“I don’t want protection in exchange for my other family members or friends or other immigrants who have found a better life in this country being sold out,” a DACA recipient wrote via email. “I also feel great pains about plans that create a vast second class [of] citizenship for DREAMers or their parents or other immigrants but I guess that is preferable to dreading deportation.”</h3>

<div class="words_container">
<h3 class="words">DACA recipients are distressed about a decision they aren’t actually empowered to make. They aren’t voting on the president’s proposal or any other bill; they won’t even be able to vote in the November elections for the politicians who make the right choice in the coming weeks. When a dozen or more DACA recipients attend Tuesday’s State of the Union as guests of members of Congress, they’ll be sitting alongside the people who have the power to determine their futures. But the DREAMers themselves are the ones acknowledging that the stability they seek might have a cost — and wrestling with what cost might be worth it. </h3>
